#  Objective-C Class Test

## Overview
This program allows you to type in people's names (or anything else) and it will pick one out at random. I made this to learn how to use NSStrings and  NSArrays. 

## Development Envirnment
I created this using Xcode version 12.1. To set up this project, first install Xcode if you don't have it already. Then go to Source Control->Clone and then paste in the link to this Github repository. The project should download and be setup automatically. Press the build and run button to test the code.
